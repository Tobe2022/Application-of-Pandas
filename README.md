# Application-of-Pandas

# I used Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer these questions about 12 monthsâ€™ worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.
# I began by cleaning the dataset, dropping NaN values from DataFrame, removed rows where necessary, changed the date column from numeric to date-time.
# Next, I was able to answer these high-level business questions;
# The best month for sales and how much was earned that month? 
# What city sold the most product? 
# The most appropriate time to display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customers buying products? 
# What products are most often sold together? And, 
# What product sold the most? 
# Libraries used; Pandas, Numpy, MatPlotLib.
